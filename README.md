# Doc2Map

Doc2Map is an algorithm for **topic modeling and visualization**. It can read any type of document files, but not OCR them. It will find topics base on the core idea of [Top2Vec](https://github.com/ddangelov/Top2Vec) and hierarchicaly display them on a map similar to a Google Map:

Or on a scatter plot with a munual zoom level:

# Using Doc2Map

There is two way of using Doc2Map:

 - Windows Binary
 - Importing it in a Python Script

## Windows Binary

If you are on windows, you can simply download the binary and launch it. Once launch, you will have to wait a little for the programm to start, then you will be asked what folder you want to analyse:

Select the folder with the document you want to cartography.

For the next step, you will have to be patient. Doc2Map will analyse and convert into plain text your docuemnt, then organise them. Depending of the format, the size and the number of documents, it may take a long time...

When finished, two web pages will be automaticaly launch on your browser to show you different vcartography of you documents.

## Importing in a Python Script

If you want to use Doc2Map with python, you have first to install it:
```
pip install Doc2Map
```

Then, you will have to import it:
```python
from Doc2Map import Doc2Map
```

# How Does It Work?

Doc2Map is mainly based on the Top2Vec principle, and rely on Plotly and Leaflet to create beautiful visuals.
